##Abstraction & Interface


Showing only essential features and hiding the inner details to reduce complexity.
Eg: Car-->Engine, Brake mechanism -->Hidden
Essential features-->Steering, wheel, brake,gear etc.

How?
Abstract class
Interface


-->Abstract method can be implemented only in child class. Definition is given in parent class.
-->A class without abstract method is a concrete class.
-->Object cannot be created for abstract class and interface class.

-->All variables inside interface is automatically static and final.
-->Variables can be accessed using interface name. Not using object.
For example. If interface name is A1 and variable is a , then a can be accessed like A1.a.
